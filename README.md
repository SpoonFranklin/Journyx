Coding Challenge Solution

Hey all, just a couple of notes ass you're looking into this thing. 

The codebase is pretty small, but I've added some comments to make things readable, ffeel free to ping me with any questions about why I chose to do something one way or another.
As far as testing/running, I've made it pretty insular, so you'll change the input string within the code itself (the first line, inputString). 
I could have made it so that input was taken from the command line, or that it was parsed some other way, but given the problem statement, I figured having it be able to be run and done would work for what you were looking for. 

Other than the input, you'll also see a printed version of the string upon completion of the code. Figured that'd be easiest for testing/what have you, but again, a simple change to have it all just return the formatted string.

Thanks for taking the time to review!
